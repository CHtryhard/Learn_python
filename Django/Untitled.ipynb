    "# For this project you will be using OOP to create a card game. This card game will\n",
    "# be the card game \"War\" for two players, you an the computer. If you don't know\n",
    "# how to play \"War\" here are the basic rules:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The deck is divided evenly, with each player receiving 26 cards, dealt one at a time,\n",
    "# face down. Anyone may deal first. Each player places his stack of cards face down,\n",
    "# in front of him.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# The Play:\n",
    "#\n",
    "# Each player turns up a card at the same time and the player with the higher card\n",
    "# takes both cards and puts them, face down, on the bottom of his stack.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# If the cards are the same rank, it is War. Each player turns up three cards face\n",
    "# down and one card face up. The player with the higher cards takes both piles\n",
    "# (six cards). If the turned-up cards are again the same rank, each player places\n",
    "# another card face down and turns another card face up. The player with the\n",
    "# higher card takes all 10 cards, and so on.\n",
    "#\n",
    "# There are some more variations on this but we will keep it simple for now.\n",
